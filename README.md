# Signal-Processing

This repository contains small lab scripts demonstrating signal generation, Fourier transforms and plotting. A central `SignalToolkit` in `signal_processing_core.py` provides unified APIs for generating signals, creating Fourier matrices, plotting, and saving figures.

Quick start (Windows PowerShell):

- Install dependencies (recommended in a virtualenv):

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Notes:
- Generated charts are saved under `charts/<LabName>/` (PDF and PNG).
